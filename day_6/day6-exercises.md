Answer these questions about the reading in your `day6-exercises.md` file:

1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
1.1 When you call the function by entering 'sayHello()', it returns what was written in the statement or code block, which is Hello!

1.2 When you enter 'sayHello', it returns the entire function or function name and code block.

2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
2.1  Parameter is the variable in the declaration of function

2.2  Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to function.

3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
3.1  The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.

4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
4.1  Local Variable are better in the sense that they use less memory and have less naming conflicts than a global variable.

4.2  An instance that you might want to use a global variable could be when you need to use multiple local variables to build off a fixed/constant variable that will never change.  So you'll want that global variable to be accessed by multiple local variables.
