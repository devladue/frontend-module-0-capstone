1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
1.1 It is important to the visually impaired as it adds a description to the image for screen reading software.

2.1 Positioning of the <img>; A block <img> starts on it's own line and is followed by a block-level element.  Whereas an inline <img> sits within or inside a block-level element and does not start a new line.

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
3.1 Photographs that use many different colors are best saved as `jpg`.
3.2 Illustrations or logos that use flat, few or large areas of the same color are best saved as `png` or `gif`.



Answer these questions about the reading in your `day4-exercises.md` file:

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
2.1 An image sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface.
